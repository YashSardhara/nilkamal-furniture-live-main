    <h3>What should I look for while purchasing a coffee table?</h3>
    <p>As discussed, a coffee table enhances the beauty of your living room, so there are numerous factors that you should take into account while purchasing a coffee table. Here we go: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Check the size:</b> Measure up your living room space between the sofas to determine the size of the coffee table required. The centre table should not be lower than 3-4 inches from the seat of your sofa. The standard height of the centre table is usually between 15-20 inches. </li>
        <li><b>Select the shape:</b> Square and rectangular tables are the most commonly bought as they are extendable; you can join two or three tables together if you have guests. Round or oval tables are ideal if you have kids as they don't have edgy corners and gives a little more space to walk around.</li>
        <li><b>Functionality:</b> Consider the usage of the coffee table. Do you want it to be decorative, or do you need storage space as well? We have centre tables with shelves and drawers to keep your snacks, cutlery, books and other valuable items.</li>
        <li><b>Choose the suitable material:</b> To choose the right material for a coffee table, you need to balance factors like price, style, and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, glass and plastic.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Your stylish <b>computer table</b> needs regular maintenance to preserve its elegant
          appearance and remain optimally functional for a long time. Here are the best expert
          tips to take care of your <b>computer table</b> to retain its looks:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Daily Cleaning-</b>Whether you use your <b>computer table</b> at home or office, it is
            essential to clean it daily. A clean table is always attractive and looks organised.
            To clean table dust it with a brush or microfibre cloth. Daily furniture dusting
            restricts the accumulation of dirt and debris. After furniture dusting, if you see
            any tough stains or marks, clean them with mild cleaners or a damp cloth. In
            case you have a wooden <b>computer table</b>, ensure to dry the table afterwards to
            avoid warping.</li><br>
            <li><b>Table Cover-</b>With regular use, there are chances of your <b>computer table</b>
            getting scratched or dented. Use a table cover to protect it to avoid accidental
            scratches and damage. A table cover will protect your <b>computer table</b> from
            accidental spills and scratches, plus it will also aid in maintaining a clean table.
            The table cover will act as a table protector to safeguard the good looks of your
            <b>computer table</b> for a long time.</li><br>
            <li><b>Table Placemats-</b>When you work on your <b>computer table</b>, sometimes you eat
            or drink while working or studying. The glasses can leave water marks, and the
            hot plates can damage the surface of your <b>computer table</b>. So, whenever eating
            or drinking, use a placemat. The placemat will act as a table protector against
            heat and water.</li>

Here are some of the benefits of adding a dining bench to your home.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>More seating capacity:</b> Dining benches are perfect for large gatherings whenever additional seating is required.

      <li><b>Versatile:</b> The dining bench is quite versatile and can be used in any setup. Besides the dining room, you can place a then in the kitchen, balcony, terrace or garden.</li>
      <li><b>Space-saving:</b> When the dining table is not in use, you can push the dining bench entirely under the table to increase the living room’s free space. This will make your dining room look neater and less cluttered.</li>
      <li><b>Design feature:</b> A dining bench seat, if upholstered nicely, can also amp up the room’s overall décor. So always choose the fabrics that look premium and stylish.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>How to select the perfect dining bench for your dining table</h3>
    <p>The dining table and dining bench are the focal points of the living room or dining room. You must choose the right furniture according to the overall ambience of the room. Here are some essential factors to consider while choosing the dining bench.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Measure up your space and the dining table:</b> The length of the dining bench should be equal to or a bit lesser than the length of the dining table since only then will you be able to tuck the bench under the table. If you are planning to position your bench against the wall, make sure to measure the backrest height to check if it fits any radiators, panelling or windowsills.</li>
      <li><b>Backrest or backless:</b> A dining bench with a backrest offers more support as you can lean back comfortably while sitting. They also create a better visual impact on the room decor if you want to add a style element. It also allows you to squeeze more people even if the sitting becomes a snugger. Backless dining benches are suitable for compact dining rooms as they can be tucked under the table when not in use.</li>
      <li><b>Dining bench colour and pattern:</b> Most people choose a dining bench that harmonises with the design of the dining table. Sometimes the intentional mismatches also look attractive. So you can use your creativity to create something exceptional.</li>
      <li><b>Extendable seats:</b> Certain dining benches can be joined end to end to extend the seating space. If you need that kind of seating arrangement, then choose benches with extendable seats.</li>

    <h3>Choosing the perfect dining chairs for your dining table</h3>
    <p>The dining table and dining chairs are the statement pieces of the living room or dining room. You must choose the ideal chairs according to the overall ambience of the room. Here are some essential factors to consider while choosing dining chairs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Chair height:</b> The overall dimensions of the dining chairs should be compatible with the dining table. The difference between the height of the top of the dining chair and the tabletop should be between 8-12 inches. So measure the table height and choose the chairs accordingly. Remember that the upholstered chairs compress slightly when you sit on them, so consider it while making your final decision.</li>
      <li><b>Chair width and depth:</b> Chairs are usually pushed under the table when the dining table is not in use. The width and depth of the chair determine if the chair can completely fit under the table or not.</li>
      <li><b>Armed or unarmed:</b> Armed chairs are more comfortable, but you can’t fit them under the table. Unarmed chairs save space in the room when the table is not in use.</li>
      <li><b>Back height:</b> Choose dining chairs with a back that extends at least 2-3 inches above the table height. Chairs designed with a very low back compared to the table height look odd and can be harmful to your back.</li>
      <li><b>Chair colour and pattern:</b> Most people choose dining chairs that match well with the designs of your dining table. Sometimes the intentional mismatches also look attractive. So you can use your creativity to create something exceptional.</li>
      <li><b>Spacing dining chairs:</b> When you arrange dining chairs around the dining table, they must have at least 20 inches of space between them measured from the seat’s centre. The spacing is required for enough elbow room. If your table is large, then you can be more generous with the spacing.</li>
      <li><b>Extra dining chairs:</b> If you have extra dining chairs, you can use them with small <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/coffee-tables"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><u>coffee tables</u></span></a> to increase the seating space.</li>

<br>
<h2> <strong>How To Choose the Right Dressing Table Online? </strong> </h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the wide variety of alternatives on the market, choosing the right type of </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your bedroom can take time and effort. For a </span> <strong>good makeover</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, it needs to blend well with the bedroom's furnishings, lighting, and other decorations. You should make the following considerations while buying a </span> <strong>dressing table online</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Find what works best for you </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making a purchase, think about the features you require from the dresser. If you have a limited amount of area in your </span> <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bed-room"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bedroom</span></a></u> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can get a tall and thin dresser. Choose short dressers instead if you need a dressing table to take up more space in your bedroom. Wide drawers and lots of room for storage are possible in a short dresser. Additionally, you can utilise the dresser as a </span> <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bedside-tables"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bedside table</span></a></u> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the height complements the bed.</span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Choose a stylish design that complements the rest of your furniture </strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nilkamal offers a wide range of </span> <strong>modern dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> designs, from minimalist to rustic, modern to contemporary, tall or short, simple or ornate, and drawers or doors. Making your dressing table the same colour as your walls will make your furniture appear more subdued. Consider bringing some colour into your bedroom. Instead of blending into your surroundings, look for colours to enhance them. Typically, adding colour that is a few shades darker or lighter than your wall colour can draw attention to it.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> <strong> <strong>Select a dressing table as per the size of your bedroom </strong> </strong> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Size is yet another crucial factor to consider when selecting a </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">. A larger </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> can take up excessive room in your bedroom. On the other hand, a little dressing table won't offer any storage advantages. The size of your bedroom and the amount of storage you need should guide your decision.</span></p>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> <strong> <strong>Choose the suitable material for your furniture </strong> </strong> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proper material should be chosen by weighing aspects, including cost, style, and simplicity of maintenance. Mild steel, MDF, and engineered wood are the most widely used materials.</span></p>
<br>

<h2> <strong>Which Type of Dressing Table With Mirror is Best for You? </strong> </h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various choices, from corner models that might fit into small areas to dressing tables with snug cupboards. Look through the list below to simplify your shopping.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Mirrored Dressing Table to check your outfit and makeup </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common style of </span> <strong>dressing table with mirror</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">. It frequently has a medium- to large-sized mirror on top and two or three storage drawers at the bottom. You can use the mirrors on these tables to get ready and assess your appearance. The drawers can be used to store your skincare and makeup essentials. It is best to buy a dressing table with multiple drawers to make space for your products. Another benefit of adding a traditional </span> <strong>dressing table with mirror</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it will create the illusion of extra space in your bedroom.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Wall-Mounted Dressing Table to save space in your room </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hanging dressing table should be ideal if you prefer straightforward, discreet designs. A tiny mirror with slots connected to either side for basics like hair products and brushes, skincare products, cosmetics, and more is commonly part of this space-saving design that works well in a bedroom with little space.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Dressing Table with Storage to keep items safe </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of a dressing table's most important characteristics is how much storage capacity it offers. It can be configured in several ways. Dressing tables might have long, deep drawers or rows of smaller ones, allowing you to organise your possessions separately. </span> <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dressing-tables-with-shelves"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dressing tables with shelves</span></a></u> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> are perfect for folks who prefer to reach their belongings rather than dig through multiple drawers readily. Consider decorating the shelves with decorative items and floral arrangements for an extra touch of charm.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Dressing Table with Seating </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a comfortable chair next to your vanity allows you to take your time getting dressed, which is fun. One alternative is to get a stool and </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> that match. A pouffe with plush velvet upholstery can add to the overall aesthetic appeal. However, a conventional ottoman must be your go-to option if you want a sturdier seating option with the additional height.</span></p>
<br>
<h2> <strong>Essential Things to Remember Before Buying A Dressing Table with a Mirror</strong> </h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some suggestions you should consider before you prey on a</span> <strong> stylish design.</strong> </p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many tables include complex designs, </span> <strong>dressing table with mirror</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> and drawers are very popular due to their stunning appearance and versatility. Find the correct size by first deciding the corner or exact dimensions where the furniture unit will sit.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must ppt for storage over aesthetics. An overflowing bedroom makes storage a necessity. An excellent choice would be a dressing table with more storage instead of an eye-catching style. You need enough space if you deal with many accessories, makeup products, skincare items, etc. Purchase a </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the most storage capacity to separate and hold all your necessities. Your accessories and expensive goods can be stored safely in large drawers and cabinets.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan to store your valuable jewellery pieces in dressing tables, ensure your </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a safety feature to protect them. Look for a design with cupboards with a locking feature to store your priceless possessions, such as jewellery, a passport, essential papers, and other items. Look for several keys so you can use the backup key if one is lost and avoid having to break the lock. </span> <strong>Modern dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a great designs and offer safety for your valuable items.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't forget about your budget: Whether you make a large or small purchase, your budget should not be overlooked. Sort the dressing table designs based on the price range you are willing to accept. You may find a wide variety of dressing tables online that are affordable. Choose the type of material&mdash;wood, plastic, or metal&mdash;that best fits your budget.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2> <strong>How Do You Choose the Ideal Mirror for a Dressing Table Online? </strong> </h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selecting a </span> <strong>dressing table with mirror</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are three things to look for.</span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Glass quality</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Silvering in the mirror</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The glass's thickness</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can determine the glass's quality by touching the surface. There should be no bumps or dips on the mirror; it should be flat. Due to the glass, you shouldn't appear bigger, shorter, leaner, taller, or slimmer than you are. The process of mirroring involves treating the glass' surface with chemicals such as silver nitrate to make it reflective. The better it is, the more coating there is. Mirrors that are too thin last only a short time and don't reflect light well.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Lighting Options for Mirrors on Dressing Tables </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your dressing area can be improved visually by adding lighting in several ways. However, ambient lighting works best if your bedroom is small and lacks natural light. Here are some lighting solutions that might give your dressing area a lovely appearance:</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Ambient Lighting </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, natural light is the best for ensuring optimum sight during your grooming procedures. Additionally, ambient lighting can assist you in maximising natural illumination. Fixtures like wall lighting, spotlights, track lights, table lamps, and others can help create ambient lighting around your grooming area.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Accent Lighting </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accent lighting draws attention to a specific object and creates a striking and dramatic effect. It can be done with the aid of wall-mounted fixtures, under-cabinet lighting, slim bars, strip lighting, and other things.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Task Lighting </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task lighting creates the desired brightness in a particular area and improves visuals to help you accomplish jobs more effectively. Over the dressing table or in the space beneath wall-mounted cabinets or mirrors, you can place them in LED lights.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Mood Lighting </strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood lighting is decorative lighting that is gentle and colourful. With the aid of fairy lights, mirror backlighting, and other features, you can effortlessly include them on the </span> <strong>dressing table</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">. These lights typically use less energy than different types of lighting and have cutting-edge features that let you change the brightness or colour to suit the environment.</span></p>

  <h3>Plastic chairs for home: Some styling tips</h3>
  <p>Plastic chairs are the most stylish furniture pieces in the market today. Nilkamal’s plastic chairs are versatile, innovative and specifically designed for comfort with premium plastic. No matter how many chairs you already have, you may run out of seating if you host a house party. This is the reason it is always good to keep extra chairs at home. Since plastic chairs are lightweight and easy to move, they can be stacked in the backyard when not required. These chairs can also be styled in different ways to add a premium touch. Here are some of the styling tips.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can decorate a basic plastic chair by adding colourful pillows if the chair is armed or use a colourful cushion pillow pad if the chair is unarmed. It is always better to choose a contrasting pillow and if you are using multiple pillows, make sure they match each other. Similarly, if you have a rustic home décor theme, go for geometric prints or baroque prints. If you have bright contemporary themes, then try quirky, bohemian prints.</li>
    <li>Try adding a matching ottoman with your chairs for relaxing your body after a long hectic day at work. Just turn on the TV, get your munching snack, sit on your plastic chair and imagine placing your feet on a soft and comfortable ottoman. It will give you a heaven-like comfort feeling.</li>
    <li>If you are bored with your monotone plastic chair, then you are decorating your chair with bright wall stickers or spray paint to give it a complete makeover. This is an excellent way of revamping your old furniture.</li>

  <h3>Sectional sofa: A luxurious addition to your living room</h3>
  <p>A living room is a primary place where you spend most of your time reading, listening to music or watching TV, a place where the family and friends exchange conversations, thoughts and laughter.

Some also have built-in sleeper beds, while you can convert others into a bed. A <b>sectional sofa</b> is a long term investment, and it is anchor <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/living-room"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><u>furniture for a living room</u></span></a> or drawing-room. So, choosing the right one is crucial for achieving the desired style. Nilkamal’s collection of sofa sets is quite diverse and versatile to match any home décor. There are various colours, patterns and materials, so even if your house has rustic, contemporary or vibrant designs, they can fit well.</p>

We offer a wide range of sofas that are made up of superior quality wood and durable fabrics. You can browse through our extensive catalogue of <span style="color: #1cb963;"><b>modern L shaped sofa</b></span>, <span style="color: #1cb963;"><b>U shaped sofa</b></span>, modular sofa, <span style="color: #1cb963;"><b>sectional couch</b></span> and many more.</p>
  <h3>Points to consider while selecting the perfect sectional sofa</h3>
  <p>Sectional sofa is a space-efficient furniture piece that also creates an elegant environment in the room. It provides plenty of seating space to a family, and everyone gets a seat along with total comfort. Finding a perfect sectional sofa is also a big task and one of the most crucial investments you make for your home because they are expensive and need to last longer. While you can experiment with multiple designs, here are the four most important things you should consider when buying a sectional sofa.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Orientation</b>: While picking up the sectional sofa, you need to check the orientation. You can find LHS sectional sofa, RHS sectional sofa and corner sofas. LHS sectional sofas have a left-hand side configuration - that means they can be placed in a room where the door is on the right side. RHS sectional sofas are opposite as they are designed for rooms where the door is on the left. The corner sofas are designed for spacious rooms, and they usually come along with an open end where you can place the serving table. You can choose from 3 to 8 seater sectional sofas according to your space and requirement. Always measure your place with tape before buying a couch to determine the maximum sofa dimension that can fit well in your area. Also, pay attention to the height of the sofa, especially if your room has shelving or radiators.</li>
    <li><b>Select colours and designs according to the room</b>: You can place the sectional sofa in a living room, drawing room, study room and bedroom. Make sure the sofa you select goes well with the room's overall décor theme and serves the purpose. You can pick big corner sofas for the living room that can offer a lot of seating space. Add beautiful lighting, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/recliners"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>recliner</u></b></span></a> and a classic <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/coffee-tables"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>coffee table</u></b></span></a> to complete the look. For the study room, select an elegant and sleek sectional sofa in neutral colours. You can place a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/study-tables"><span style="color: #1d5ecf;"><b><u>study table</u></b></span></a> with a lovely table lamp and some motivational stickers to have a perfect ambience. Bedrooms look amazing with bucket sofas and a <span style="color: #1cb963;"><b>sectional couch</b></span> set near a window or a balcony. A sectional sofa always acts as a focal point in a room, and adding colours and patterns makes it more exciting.</li>
    <li><b>Invest in a sturdy frame</b>: A furniture frame plays a vital role in deciding strength and longevity. Hardwood frame is always a good option. Also, look for sofas that have a manufacturer warranty. Nilkamal’s furniture provides a good return on investment due to the high-quality material and skilled craftsmanship. We have wooden <span style="color: #1cb963;"><b>L shape sofa corners</b></span> having intricately designed legs with square, round and triangular patterns.</li>
    <li><b>Focus on the fabric</b>: Consider your usage and lifestyle while deciding on a sofa fabric. Sensuous and glossy fabrics like silk, velvet, brocade are perfect for sophisticated spaces like drawing rooms or hotel receptions. Whereas easy to clean materials, such as PVC or stain-guarded twill, are ideal for kids' and living rooms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Paying attention to these four factors can ensure that not only do you get a good investment when buying the sectional sofa, but it accurately matches the mood and decor of the rest of the room. Such considerations can enhance the look of the room in an unbelievable manner.</p>
  <h3>Advantages of buying a sectional sofa</h3>
  <p>Is there anything more annoying than having a house party and you run out of seating? A sectional sofa can solve this problem by providing a lot of seating space. Moreover, it is also an economical option if you compare the per-seat price with a similar single-seater or a three-seater sofa. Its configuration is quite conducive to close interactions, and you can perfectly enjoy watching a movie or a football match with your friends. Lastly, a sectional sofa being an oversize piece of furniture, can instantly grace up your living room. You can easily decorate the sofa by placing bright and beautiful sofa covers and matching cushions.</p>

  <h3>Sofa come bed: a buying guide</h3>
  <p>A <b>sofa cum bed furniture</b> is a sofa that can be converted into a bed with an easy to pull out mechanism. Many people prefer the idea of getting a sofa cum bed instead of a traditional sofa. But before you choose one, ensure that you make the right choice. After all, buying a furniture piece is a long term investment, so getting the perfect option is important. To ease your selection task, we have curated certain factors that need to be considered before buying a sofa come bed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Measure up the available space</b>: Before you start searching for a <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>sofa cum bed</b></span>, measure up the space you have in your living room. Of course, you are getting it to utilize your space efficiently. So keep in mind the space required for placement and opening up the sofa cum bed. You must do the whole planning according to its placement; there should be enough space available on the front side so that you can easily pull the bed out. Also, check that it doesn’t give a cramped look to the room.</li>
    <li><b>Check the design and features</b>: Choose the style that will blend in well with the interior of your place at its best. You can place a <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>sofa come bed</b></span> in a living room, drawing room, study room or kid’s bedroom. Check the shape of your room and go for designs that upscale the interior of the room. For the study room, you can pick classic designs and neutral shades. For the living room or drawing room, select an eye-catching design according to the existing decor. Many <span style="color: #06b254;"><b>sofa cum bed latest design</b></span> options are multifunctional, and some offer additional seating while some provide you extra storage space. If your primary requirement is storage, then go for styles that have inbuilt storage boxes or storage drawers.</li>
    <li><b>Invest in a good frame and fabric</b>: Getting a lucrative deal doesn’t mean you should compromise quality. A frame of the furniture plays a vital role in deciding strength and longevity. Apart from frame quality, also check the fittings and fixtures inside. Inadequate padding and abrupt fittings can cause discomfort. Consider your usage and lifestyle while deciding on an upper fabric. Sensuous and glossy fabrics like silk, velvet, brocade are perfect for sophisticated spaces like drawing rooms.

<h2> <strong>Complete Guide to Buying Seating Furniture</strong> </h2>
<br>
<p>You must consider several factors when purchasing <strong> seating furniture</strong>  for your little one. Here's a list of things to remember:</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Size and Design of the Chair</strong> Purchasing furniture for growing children can be difficult. Young children grow fast, and the chairs that fit them ideally might soon become obsolete. So buying a proper  <strong>size</strong>  kids' chair that may be used even after your child grows into new measurements is a wise investment. Additionally, the design of the  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/chairs">chair</a></u>  is also essential. There is no one-size-fits-all  <strong>quality</strong>  for children's furniture. As parents, you can go crazy with the  <strong>designs </strong> or keep them necessary for long-term use; the choice is yours. You can also sit down alongside your children and look through Nilkamal Furniture's charming selection to pick a style that resonates with them.</h3>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Material of your Seating</strong> </h3>
<p>Plastic is your best bet if you're looking for a portable and lightweight  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/plastic-kids-chair">children's chair</a></u>   <strong>materia</strong> l. Metal chairs are also lightweight and durable compared to wooden chairs. But if you want timeless and elegant furnishing that blends in with the other decor of your home, a wooden chair will be a better option. You can also go through the catalogue available on the Nilkamal Furniture to make your selection and get a hassle-free  <strong>delivery </strong> within the next couple of days.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Comfort Factor</strong> </h3>
<p>You can make your child's seating furniture cosier by adding cushion padding or upholstering. However, upholstered wood, plastic, or metal chairs will compel your kids to maintain upright positions throughout. If you're looking for upholstery or fabric cushioning, you can opt for lively, colourful  <strong>designs</strong>  to make the chair look more pleasant. It is also essential to select the proper  <strong>size</strong>  for a chair- it should neither be too tall nor too short and allow your child's feet to touch the ground.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Added Safety Features</strong> </h3>
<p>While purchasing seating furniture, safety will be your primary concern. Wheels and locking mechanisms can often be helpful in a kid's furniture. However, such additional  <strong>material</strong>  is also dangerous when left unattended. Ensure your child is observed using such furniture items or appropriately trained to handle them themselves. Another key safety feature is pointy edges- your kid's chairs should not have sharp edges that can lead to unwanted injuries.</p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Cost of the Seating</strong> </h3>
<p>Raising a child entails several expenses. Therefore, children's furniture's  <strong>price</strong> ,  <strong>quality</strong> , and affordability must also be considered. Not only should the chair be cosy and comfortable, but it should also be inexpensive and durable. A good kids' chair will usually be adjustable and can be adjusted according to a child's changing height.&nbsp;</p>
<br>

<h2> <strong>Guide to Cleaning and Maintaining Office Chairs - Nilkamal Furniture </strong> </h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular maintenance and cleaning are significant if you want to use your office chair for the long term and refrain from purchasing them repeatedly. Whether working from home or in a cubicle, you can spend most of the time sitting in your office chair. You tend to make your office chair untidy by dropping food crumbs or spilling drinks unknowingly. Also, the continuous weight it holds, the dirt accumulation and the prolonged movement it endures necessitate the need to clean often. Follow the below pointers while cleaning and maintaining your office chair.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Look for the Tag</strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to look carefully at the care tag from your manufacturer. Most </span> <strong>office chairs</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> have tags beneath them with cleaning instructions and codes. You can use water-based cleaning agents only if you see a code W. Alternate with water-free solvents if you find a code A. Only a W/S tag indicates that you are free to use water-free and water-based cleaning products, and code X means that you must use only a </span> <strong>vacuum</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Vacuuming</strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a handheld or cordless stick vacuum and make </span> <strong>vacuuming </strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">your office chair a smooth process. You can use a vacuum to remove the dust and allergens at least twice a month, which helps eliminate nanoscopic particles that threaten your fabric or chair leather. Make sure you are </span> <strong>vacuumming</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the parts, such as the armrest, head, seat and backrest, for a thorough and intense cleaning. Alternatively, try a duster or a can of compressed air to blow out dirt particles that a vacuum can't.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Upholstery Cleaning</strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning the fabric on your furniture is necessary to remove dirt/oily stains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<h4> <strong>Fabric chair</strong> </h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can clean your </span> <strong>fabric chair</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> with warm water/ water-solvent cleaning product to remove blemishes/ spots on the fabric. Try blotting the stained area to pull out the stain from the material.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<h4> <strong>Faux leather chair</strong> </h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leather types have a porous surface and can absorb moisture easily. So, clean it with a conditioner like saddle soap or mink oil to prevent leather peeling.</span></p>
<br>
<h4> <strong>Mesh chair</strong> </h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform a spot cleaning with water and soap or do vacuum cleaning.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Castor Lubrication</strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find any obstruction in the movement, it is because of clogged castors. Flip your office chair upside down, and pull the wheels off. Use a knife to get rid of dirt/gunk. Also, scrape the hair from the wheels. You can clean the castors with a damp cloth and spray lubricant. Try to clean the castors once in six months or when you find an obstruction.</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Replace Gas Cylinder</strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiencing sinking is common in an office chair; the culprit is the gas cylinder. When the pneumatic lift is hampered, the gas cylinder on your office chair calls for replacement. You can contact the chair supplier and replace it with the actual size and cylinder type.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<h3> <strong>Tighten the Chair Bolts and Screws</strong> </h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolving chairs often need screw tightening every six months. Check the loose ends, and use the right tools to tighten the screws and bolts. You may need a screw/bolt replacement altogether if tightening doesn't work.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow these simple steps to clean and maintain the sparkle of your office chair. Regular care and maintenance can prevent your office chair from mechanical wear and tear and make them long-lasting. You can opt for professional cleaning services if you last cleaned your office chair a long time ago and need deep cleaning.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2> <strong>Practical Pointers to Pick Appropriate Wardrobes Online &nbsp;</strong> </h2>
<br>
<p>Some tips needed to choose and  <strong>buy wardrobe</strong>  for homes have been outlined below.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Wardrobe Size </strong> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The space designated for a wardrobe must be kept in mind before choosing the appropriate  <strong>wardrobe</strong>  since it has to fit in the bedroom space. One needs to take the exact dimensions of the space and then select a desired  <strong>wardrobe size</strong> . The design of the wardrobe also has to be chosen in a suitable type that matches the bedroom interiors.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Type of Storage Needed</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The kind of clothes to be stored within the wardrobe also decides the type of wardrobe to be bought. If one mainly uses clothes that need to be hung rather than folded, a cabinet with more hanging space is required over one with more drawers or shelves. Items like coats, suits, sarees, gowns, floor-length dresses, etc., need more hanging-type  <strong>storage capacity</strong>  rather than folded storage.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Wardrobe Aesthetics </strong> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The wardrobe style must also be carefully selected to match the concept to the bedroom theme. A traditional wardrobe design will be unsuitable for a contemporary-styled bedroom and vice versa. Similarly, a wardrobe with a mirror can make a massive difference within the bedroom. If a mirror is already in the bedroom elsewhere, then the need for a  <strong>mirror wardrobe</strong>  is omitted. Check out the varying designs available and choose accordingly.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Wardrobe Material </strong> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The  <strong>wardrobe material</strong>  may be chosen as desired from wood, particle board, metal, etc. Confirm the durability and sturdiness of the materials used before buying the  <strong>wardrobe online</strong> . Matching themes in the other  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bed-room">bedroom furniture</a></u>, such as the  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bedside-tables">bedside tables</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bed">bed</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dressing-tables">dressing table</a></u>,  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/chests-of-drawers">chest of drawers</a></u>, etc., should be chosen for uniformity and aesthetic look. Make sure the wardrobe is made of wood if the bed and other bedroom furniture are made from wood. The colour of the cabinet also influences the bedroom look. So make sure the most appropriate colour and finish is chosen too.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Wardrobe Price </strong> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Investing in a good-quality wardrobe is essential for long-lasting use. We all wish to have a pleasant and cosy environment when we go to bed; hence, it is necessary to choose a wardrobe in a favourable colour too. Compromising quality due to the looks is unwise as durability is not assured. So ensure to check the  <strong>wardrobe price</strong>  and keep a specific budget in mind before you  <strong>buy wardrobe online</strong> .&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h3> <strong>Varieties of Wardrobe Designs Available Online</strong> </h3>

<br>
<p>One of the best ways to add lighting to the bedroom is by adding a  <strong>wardrobe with mirror</strong> . The reflected light makes the room vibrant and sparkly. The mirror also makes the room appear spacious. No more is the need for a dressing table as the wardrobe can be used most advantageously. Elegance can be combined with practicality most finely. Make the best of the smart furniture concept in the most appealing way.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Factors to consider while picking up work from home chairs</h3>
  <p>Most of the work chairs are ergonomically designed. These chairs tend to be more comfortable as they ensure proper posture and offer the necessary support. While selecting a regular chair, you can experiment with multiple colours and designs, and chairs can provide you with an excellent option to flex your creative muscles. However, when selecting the chair for working, some essential criteria can help you choose the right chair.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The seat: The seat is the place where you sit. There are two critical features related to the chair's seat: adjustable height and adjustable angle. In some chairs, you can adjust the height to match up the level of the table or the computer screen. This adjustability can avoid unnecessary pressure on the wrist or the back. Similarly, you can also adjust the seat to a specific angle that you may want for better comfort.</li>
    <li>The backrest: The backrest provides support to the back and helps maintain a healthy sitting posture. Some chairs have a protrusion in the lower area that supports the lower back. In models, you can adjust the height of the backrest as well.</li>
    <li>The armrest for shoulder positioning: The armrest is where you can rest your arms when you are not working on a mouse or a keyboard. Armrest usually has three critical features: adjustable width, adjustable height and removability. Other than this, some models come with padded armrests. Armrest padding is beneficial if you have pain in your elbow. </li>
    <li>Reclining feature: Some WFH chairs are designed with reclining features. They have a tilt tension lock that lets you recline. Else, you would have had to sit upright all the time without any relaxation.</li>
    <li>The headrest: The cushioned headrest is where you can put your head when you are in listening or watching mode. At this time, you may not have to extend your arms to the desk, and you can comfortably relax your head.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We have covered almost all specific features of work from home chairs. Now you can make your choice according to your preference and requirements. </p>
