<h3>Mattress Buying Guide</h3>
Buying a <b>mattress</b> is as important as buying ingredients for a healthy diet, if not more. A <b>mattress</b> should help align your back with the rest of your body and keep your body weight well distributed. If you are still wondering how to choose the right mattress, follow this <b>mattress buying guide</b> before buying your next Nilkamal <b>mattress online</b>:
<ul>
  <li><b>Dimensions:</b> A <b>mattress</b> can only be used to its full potential when it perfectly fits the bed frame. Thus, while buying a mattress you should be sure of the dimensions of your bed. This will avoid any spillover from the sides or uncomfortable gaps between the <b>mattress</b> and the bed frame. For this purpose, two of the most standard dimensions for double beds include <b>king size mattress</b> and <b>queen size mattress</b> options.</li>
  <li><b>Thickness:</b> <b>Nilkamal mattresses</b> come in varying thicknesses - 4-inch, 5-inch, 5.5-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inch. You can choose the right thickness depending on the height of your bed frame and the size of your bedroom. Smaller rooms seemingly look wider with lower heights.</li>
  <li><b>Softness and Health Benefits:</b> Softness and health benefits are some of the most important factors to be considered when buying a new <b>mattress</b>. You should take into consideration any back or posture issues that are preventing you from getting a good night’s sleep and how your mattress can help with that. If your bed is directly in front of your wardrobe, choose a height and softness that allows you to sit and look into the <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/wardrobes"><b><u>wardrobe</u></b></a>, saving space and maximising comfort for that short time.</li>
  <li><b>Colour:</b> Choosing the right colour is also important if you are concerned about the cleanliness of the <b>mattress</b>. Since any stains will be more visible on lighter-coloured <b>mattresses</b>, it is not advisable for families with small kids. Some mattresses also come in pleasant designs and colours and you may want to leave them exposed. In such cases, match the colour and design with your other furniture, such as your <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/computer-tables"><b><u>computer table</u></b></a> or almirah and choose the right one.</li>
  <li><b>Price:</b> It is necessary for you to determine your budget before <b>online mattress shopping</b>. This way you can stay within your budget by considering the <b>mattress cost</b> against your determined budget. However, it should not lead to any compromise on quality and comfort.</li>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
  <b>1. Which is better - memory foam or spring <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress?</b>
A <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>memory foam mattress</b> is more sturdy and dense and it also takes on the shape of your spine. While spring <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattresses</b> also provide support, the springs may start losing their shape over time, making them less durable. Thus, for the long-term, a <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>memory foam mattress</b> is the better option.
  <b>2. What are the different sizes of <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattresses?</b>
Generally, <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattresses</b> come in the King, Queen, Twin and Full sizes. However, on the Nilkamal website, you will find a huge variety of dimensions suited to your needs ensuring a perfect fit.
  <b>3. What are the materials used for making <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattresses?</b>
<span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>Mattresses</b> are generally made using coir, foam or springs. Apart from this, materials like cotton, latex, polyurethane, EPE, and PU foam are also used.
  <b>4. Which type of <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress is best?</b>
The <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>best mattress</b> is one that suits your needs. There is no universally acknowledged <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>best mattress</b>. If you want a hard and flat surface, go for a <span style="color:#195bcd;"><b>coir mattress</b>; if you share the bed with someone but want uninterrupted sleep, then go for a <span style="color:#195bcd;"><b>spring mattress</b>. However, if you have back pain and spine alignment issues, a <span style="color:#195bcd;"><b>foam mattress</b> is your best choice.
  <b>5. How do I pick the right <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress?</b>
Use the <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>mattress buying guide</b> provided above to choose the right one for you. Consider factors such as the material, price, durability, softness, colour, and dimensions when buying.
  <b>6. What kind of <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattress is good for lower back pain?</b>
A specially designed <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>orthopaedic memory foam mattress</b> is the <span style="color:#46828f;"><b>best mattress for back pain</b>. This is since it takes on the shape of your back, providing you with flexible support.
  <b>7. Are pillow top <span style="color:#3acc92;">mattresses bad for your back?</b>
Pillow top <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattresses</b> are specially designed to give soft support for your back. While they are good for your back in themselves, a pillow top <span style="color:#3acc92;"><b>mattress</b> with memory foam is even better.

  <h3>Tips and Tricks to Choose the <span style="color:#76a5af;">Best Home Furniture</h3>
  Choosing <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>home furniture</b> seems to be a simple task for some, while some find it hard to find the ideal furniture set that complements their home decor. Therefore, you should consider the following factors before purchasing furniture.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Theme:</b> Before you look for your <b>home furniture</b>, you should decide on an appropriate theme. Rather than looking for individual pieces for each room, you can decide on a comprehensive look that goes well with the vibe of your home and decide on whether you want to go for traditional or <b>modern furniture design</b> options.</li>
    <li><b>Size:</b> You may get a massive piece of <b>home furniture</b>, but it may not go well with the size of the room, making it look overbearing and congested. A piece of suitable furniture should look good with your home decor and leave some space for free movement.</li>
  	<li><b>Colour:</b> You should closely consider the tone and decoration of your room and choose an appropriate furniture colour. No matter if the furniture is of high-end quality, if the colour does not match your home's decoration, it can look unattractive.</li>
    <li><b>Durability:</b> Furniture is a long-term investment; therefore, it should be durable. <span style="color: #4a8491;"><b>Nilkamal home furniture</b> offers you durable and long-lasting pieces that come with superior designs, which add a supreme touch to your space.</li>
    <li><b>Price:</b> Buying furniture can be heavy on your pockets, especially when you are setting up a new house and have to invest in <b>home furniture</b> for the entire house. So, plan your budget and choose furniture accordingly.</li>
  	<li><b>Features:</b> An ideal furniture piece should have a functional feature that can fulfil the user's requirement. It includes the height, size, and compatibility. If you are clear about the utility factor, you can look for specific features and shop accordingly instead of buying something that does not fit the bill.</li>
    <li><b>Comfort:</b> Another crucial part of a piece of furniture is its ability to provide comfort to the users. It is not worth it if a furniture piece looks beautiful but is uncomfortable. An ergonomic <b>home furniture design</b> is worth every penny.</li>

  <h3>Make your Office a Welcome Space with Nilkamal Office Furniture</h3>
  Modern office spaces should not only have comfortable and elegant workstations but also designated break and waiting areas. Let’s look at a few aspects of modern day office furnishing.
    <b>Space Management:</b> The right kind of furniture can make your office space seemingly larger. Multi-functional furniture or <b>modular office furniture</b> can save a lot of space and money for you. A work desk that can double up as a file cabinet, or chair attached with a writing flap are designs that you can incorporate into your office space. If you believe in a more flexible and fluid environment at your workplace, you can use a lot of <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/office-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>office sofas</u></b></a> or movable chairs that can be arranged and used as per requirements.
  <b>Employee Wellness:</b> Employees spend long working hours seated at one place. It is common knowledge that modern professionals develop neck and back-related problems due to incorrect sitting postures. These become chronic health issues over prolonged periods. Suitable <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>office furniture</b> should be chosen keeping employee wellness in mind.
    <b>Improved Productivity:</b> You need to rethink your office decor if your employees are taking too many days off mainly due to falling sick or simply not wanting to be there. Uncomfortable seating or isolation due to office design directly hampers their productivity and in turn overall company performance. <b>Home office furniture</b>, such as comfortable <b>executive chairs</b>, is a modern day requirement that many are facing for the first time. 
  <b>Encourage Collaboration:</b> It’s been proven that when coworkers share best practices, overall productivity goes up and the work environment improves. Office desk sharing can be a great way of increasing productive interaction between employees. The right <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>office furniture</b> can create a sense of comradery among piers.
  <b>Brand Credibility:</b> There are brands like Google or Oracle, which are famous for creating incredible seating, resting, and waiting areas with latest <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><b>office furniture</b> designs that inspire and motivate new ideas and employee performance. This adds to the market credibility of the brand you are associated with.

  <h3>Things to consider while buying a bed</h3>
  The furniture in your house reflects your personality. Sometimes you get carried away while looking at different options of beds. Beds can provide you with an excellent option to flex your creative muscles, and you can experiment with multiple colours and designs. However, you need to consider your preferences, needs, and budget while selecting <span style="color: #10b050;"><b>bed design for bedrooms</b>. Here are few insights as to how you can choose the perfect bed for your bedroom.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Spatial area of the bedroom</b>: Before buying a bed, know the dimensions of your bedroom. Consider the dimensions of other furniture pieces you want in your room, such as <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dressing-tables"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>dressing table</u></b></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/bedside-tables"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>bedside table</u></b></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/study-tables"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>study table</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/wardrobes"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>wardrobe</u></a>, or any other item. Depending upon the space available in your bedroom, you will be able to determine the dimensions of the bed you need.</li>
    <li><b>Bed size</b>: Choose a bed size that is comfortable enough for you when you sleep. A small bed can keep your feet dangling, which is not ideal. Also, check out the shape of the beds; if you have space constraints in your kid’s room, go for a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>bunker bed</b> or <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>double-decker bed</b> instead of a regular <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>double bed design</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Colour theme and material</b>: A bed is a long term investment, so always choose a sturdy and durable material. If you choose a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>wooden double bed with storage</b>, make sure it has good moisture resistance. A steel bed must be rust-resistant. It is also essential to maintain a colour theme in the room. The design pattern should be in sync with the wallpapers and other furniture.</li>
    <li><b>Storage or non-storage bed</b>: If you have a small house without much space in the wardrobes, having a bed with storage can solve your problem. You can use the storage space to keep clothes, beddings, and much more. Some beds also have drawers that are easily accessible. You can also consider a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>hydraulic queen size bed</b> or a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>hydraulic bed king size</b> that does not have drawers, but you can store gazillion items. The storage space depends on the size of the bed. A <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>king-size bed with storage</b> can help you store many different things in one place.</li>
    <li><b>Budget</b>: You don’t have to burn a hole in your pocket for buying a <span style="color: #07b255;"><b>modern single bed</b> or double bed. You can easily filter out the beds which are within your range. Moreover, beds available on Nilkamal are affordable and provide a good return on your investment due to the high-quality craftsmanship.</li>
  </ul>
  Depending on these above-mentioned factors, you can easily select bed frames that meet all your needs. With options for storage beds, such as <b>single bed design with storage</b> and <b>modern bed design with storage</b>, you can easily maximise space even in a small room. Additionally, you can use <b>king size bed design with storage</b> to act as a storage for all your winter bedding in the summers. Even without storage options, get excellent <b>king size cot designs</b> and many more at Nilkamal.

  <h3>How to choose the right dining table for your home</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Use your measuring tape</b>: Your dining table set has to fit your dining area. Since a dining table is deceptively large, so you need to account for space around it too. In addition to the space occupied by the table, you need at least three feet of space on all sides to sit on the <b>dining table chair</b> comfortably.</li>
    <li><b>Before settling on shapes, consider your needs</b>: Square and rectangular tables are the most commonly bought. Round or oval tables are deemed great for parties and conversations as there is no head of the table. But in terms of adding more seating, you are only limited as per the table's perimeter since these shapes are non-extendable.</li>
    <li><b>Pay attention to the table support</b>: There are three common types of the table base, legs, pedestal and trestle. The table base can affect the count of people you can fit at a table. A table with thin legs or where the legs are at the corner will make it easier to squeeze an extra chair. Just be sure the support system does not invade the leg space.</li>
    <li><b>Choose the right material</b>: For choosing the right material for a dining set, you need to balance factors like price, personal style and ease of care. The most common materials are wood, mild steel, plastic and leatherette.</li>

  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <b>1. Which dining table shape is best for small rooms?</b>
  The square and round shapes of dining tables are considered perfect for small rooms.
  <b>2. What is better, wood or glass top?</b>
  If we talk about aesthetics and beauty, <b>glass top dining tables</b> always look premium and attractive. But in terms of durability, especially if there is a rough use, a wooden tabletop should be preferred.
  <b>3. What is better, a dining chair or dining bench?</b>
  Dining benches provide more seating space than chairs, and they are comparatively cheaper if you consider per-seat cost. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/dining-chairs"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><u>dining chairs</u></a> give you the flexibility of free movement, and you can also stack them if you wish to stow them away. So it depends on your usage and requirements.
  <b>4. Should the length of the dining bench match the length of the table?</b>
  The length of the dining bench should be equal to the length of the dining table or slightly shorter.
  <b>5. Which type of dining table is best?</b>
  Rectangular and square tables are the most common, so you will find more styles, design patterns, and size options in these shapes. Round and oval tables give you a little extra space to move around since it cuts off the corners. Depending on the size of your room and area requirements, you can make the selection.

              <h3><strong>How To Take Care of kids furniture</h3></strong>
              <b>kids furniture</b> is colourful and made from kid-friendly resilient materials. As kids grow
                up, within a couple of years, the <b>kids furniture</b> is no longer used. Therefore, most
                parents think it doesn&#39;t need any care. However, as kids are young and more
                susceptible to germs and other allergens, maintaining the hygiene of <b>kids furniture</b> is
                
                essential.
                Here are the ways you can take care of your <b>kids furniture</b>:

                <ul><li><b>Daily Cleaning-</b>Kids being kids, will put dirty or unclean hands on the furniture.
                Even if they don&#39;t put dirty hands, they play or do other activities. These can put
                marks or stains on their furniture. Plus, the environmental dust is already there.
                So, to ensure your kids sit, work and play on a hygienic and clean table and
                chairs, clean their furniture daily; for table dusting, use a soft microfibre. You
                can use mild cleaners with a soft, clean cloth to clean table and chairs. Don&#39;t use
                harsh chemicals or cleaners, as they will spoil the looks of the furniture. The
                traces of chemical cleaners stay long on the furniture surface, so they may harm
                young kids.</li></ul>
                <ul><li><b>Table Cover-</b>A table cover is one of the most effective ways to keep your kid&#39;s
                table clean and hygienic. A table cover acts as a barrier and keeps the table
                surface clean. You can remove the table cover and wash it to maintain optimal
                hygiene.</li></ul>

  <h3>Plan it Well With <span style="color: #45818e;">Nilkamal Sofas</h3>
  Though we often look at the colour scheme of our furniture first, there are other important aspects to consider before buying a <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>modern sofa set</b>. Below are a few points to keep in mind when you decide to <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>buy sofa sets online</b>.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Size:</b> An oversized <b>sofa set</b> or <b>recliner</b> can quickly become a burden you can’t get rid of. Or a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>2-seater sofa</u></b></a> in a large hall can make it look incomplete. Knowing the space you want to decorate and choosing the correct dimensions for your <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofa</b> is essential for it to serve the purpose.</li>
    <li><b>Utility:</b> If you entertain large groups of guests at your home, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sectional sofa</u></b></a> or <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>sofa set</b> will be a prudent buy than a <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>recliner</b> or a <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>one-seater sofa</b>. You won’t like it if you find your guests looking for a place to sit and not finding one. Similarly, a <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sofa-cum-beds"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sofa come bed</u></b></a> comes in handy when you have overnight guests or frequent sleepovers for your kids. Also, putting a <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>garden sofa</b> in your living room can be a design mismatch.</li>
    <li><b>Decor:</b> Though it’s not always necessary to have a pre-decided colour or design theme in mind before buying a <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofa</b> or <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>sofa set</b>, but knowing what you want helps in bringing some homogeneity to your decor. It’s good to have an idea whether you want a wooden or a PVC frame, or what kind of upholstery material you want.</li>
    <li><b>Budget:</b> If you have a pre-decided budget in mind, you can filter out <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofas</b> which are within your range. You can look for discounts and deals on the Nilkamal website where you can get deals with more than 50% discount.</li>
    <li><b>Durability:</b> It is important to check the quality of the frame and foam or cushions before narrowing down your search for a <span style="color: #74ae5b;"><b>sofa</b>. These are not articles that you can replace monthly or yearly. People tend to invest a huge amount on <span style="color: #3c78d8;"><b>sofa sets</b> or <a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sectional-sofas"><span style="color:#1155cc;"><b><u>sectional sofas</u></b></a> to buy good quality furniture to ensure their longevity.</li>

This is a factor that governs the entire buying process. The market is full of chests of various  <strong>size</strong> , and you need to know what fits your space. A chest that is too small will run out of storage space, and a chest that is too big will require extra space that can be used for a better  <strong>purpose</strong> . So, to avoid mismatches, it is wise to determine the  <strong>size</strong>  first.&nbsp;
<br>
<h3> <strong>Material </strong> </h3>
Until now, drawer cabinets were made from only one  <strong>material</strong> : wood. Now there are also plastic and metal ones. Plastic chests are becoming extremely popular, and they serve the same  <strong>purpose</strong>  and are generally available at a much pocket-friendly  <strong>price</strong>  than their counterparts.&nbsp;
<br>
<h3> <strong>Style </strong> </h3>
As dressers have been around for centuries, patterns have evolved a lot &ndash; there's no shortage of designs to choose from. A chest should be durable and visually appealing. Nilkamal Furniture offers chests in various attractive and elegant tones. They are sleek modern patterns. Choose the one that matches the beauty of your interior. Dressers have a noticeable impact on the overall aesthetics of a room. So make sure the  <strong>style</strong>  you choose blends in with the rest of the furniture and interior.&nbsp;

<h2> <strong>Complete Guide to Choose the Perfect 1 Seater Sofa </strong></h2>
One must keep several things in mind while buying a single-seater. Here's a  <strong>sofa buying guide</strong> to help you out:
<br>
<h3> <strong>Weather </strong></h3>
The weather in your city plays a significant role in your choice. If you live in an area that is primarily dry and experiences seasonal rainfall, then you can opt for any <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sofa-sets"> sofa set</a></u>. However, if your city is humid and prone to regular bouts of wet spells, you must opt for something other than a single leather sofa.
<br>
<h3> <strong>Presence of Children </strong></h3>
If you have children in your house, a dark-toned  <strong>1 seater sofa </strong>would be a wiser choice compared to a lighter-toned one. This minimises the risk of spillage or other stains and prevents your furniture from always looking dirty.&nbsp;
<br>
<h3> <strong>Interior Decor of Your Living Room </strong></h3>
Before buying a  <strong>1 seater sofa chair</strong>, you must consider the ambience of the  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/living-room">living room</a></u> interior. A traditional, dark-toned couch will be better if you have a moody, wood-based interior design. However, a recliner-type <strong> 1 seater sofa chai</strong>r will suit if your living room has a comfortable and laidback aura.
<br>
<h3> <strong>Colour-Scheme of the Sitting Room </strong></h3>
You must consider the colour scheme of your sitting room before opting for the  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/collections/sofa"> <strong>best sofa</strong></a></u>. A neutral-coloured sofa will be the best if your room is large, well-lit and colourful. However, if you have a smaller room, you need to get a vibrant colour  <strong>1 seater sofa</strong> to elevate your room's appearance.

<br>
<h3> <strong>Depending on Height </strong></h3>
A raised seating  <strong>1 seater sofa</strong> makes it easier to get up, but a lower seating height is more informal and relaxed.

<h2> <strong>1 Seater Sofa Based on Material </strong></h2>
Due the multitude of fabrics and support structures available for producing a one-seater couch, the fabric category is the largest. However, fabric-based couches are far more comfortable and superior for various reasons. Fabric is softer, warmer, and more durable than leather since it does not scratch.  <u><a href="https://www.nilkamalfurniture.com/">Nilkamal Furniture</a></u> offers reclining seats, pocket springs, and stain-resistant finishes in fabric couches. Rubberwood, kiln-dried wood, and plywood construct the support system. There are infinite motifs, textures, and hues accessible if you buy a sofa online to effortlessly match the one-seater fabric sofa with the current d&eacute;cor to get the desired aesthetic.&nbsp;
Different types of materials are used for making 1 seater sofa :
<br>
<h3> <strong>Plastic </strong></h3>
Apart from fabric couches, you can opt for a  <strong>plastic sofa</strong> if you want something corrosion-free, trendy, and lightweight. This type of sofa is best for people who move houses often.&nbsp;
<br>
<h3> <strong>Wood </strong></h3>
You can get on a  <strong>solid wood sofa</strong> if you want something durable and exotic. However, sofa sets made from natural wood are often expensive, so if you want to save money, you can opt for an engineered wood sofa. It has a similar finish to natural wood but puts less pressure on your pocket. These sofas do not demand much care and retain their form over time. If you have a smaller nuclear family, you may get several similar couch chairs for your sitting room and appropriately distance them out for a cosy atmosphere.&nbsp;
<br>
<h3> <strong>PVC </strong></h3>
A  <strong>PVC sofa</strong> is ideal for families with small children, and PVC material is more water- and stain resistant than leather. You can relax and eat munchies on this trendy one-seater chair without fear of stains or absorption. All you have to do is wipe it down to clean it. It is substantially more immune to dulling and fading, making it appropriate for outdoor dining.
<br>
<h3> <strong>Leather </strong></h3>
If you want to add a classy touch to your decor, then a <strong> leatherette sofa</strong> will be your perfect match. The primary benefit of leather one-seaters is its endurance and resilience. When contrasted to a softer 1 seater sofa, this type lasts longer. It has been established that a leather one-seater sofa can last longer and still looks brand new, making it an excellent investment. Another advantage provided by this type of sofa is its ease of cleaning, and unwanted stains may be immediately removed by brushing with a moist cloth. Leather sofas also offer a vintage touch to your living area, giving it a stronger presence. Since a leather one-seater sofa is associated with classic design, it is commonly linked with vintage or retro interior decoration.
<br>
<p>When considering a 1-seater sofa, the choice of material plays a pivotal role in shaping both its aesthetic and functional aspects.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A plastic sofaoffers a lightweight option ideal for versatile use.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solid wood sofaexude timeless elegance and sturdiness, adding a touch of sophistication to any space.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Engineered wood sofastrikes a balance between durability and cost-effectiveness, providing a contemporary aesthetic.&nbsp;</li>
